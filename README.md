# User-Behaviour-Analysis
This repository contains a Colab notebook project for classifying dummy news article data into several categories. The dataset simulates a media platform environment, consisting of article metadata (title, category, publish date), user activity (read, comment, share), and user comments. This project aims to reflect the typical data landscape found in media companies, and is particularly relevant for roles such as Business Intelligence Analyst or Data Scientist in digital media.

The classification workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training for category prediction. Additionally, this notebook explores basic user behavior analysis and A/B testing using Python, pandas, and statistical testing tools. The goal is to demonstrate how structured user interaction and content metadata can be leveraged to build data-driven insights and predictive models, even when working with synthetic or dummy datasets.
